# SQL---Assignment

## **Problem Introduction**

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights. For your convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are written in the script given below. You have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution in the 'Submission' segment.

**About the assignment**

1. Go through the data thoroughly before starting with the assignment. It will give you a good sense of what all the columns represent which is a good practice to follow before proceeding with the analysis. You should download the database script and run it in your local system.
2. Read through each of the instructions carefully, identify the task to be performed, and only then proceed to write the required code. Don’t perform any incorrect analysis or look for information that isn’t required for the assignment. The solution output should be in the expected format if given in the question.
3. Try using appropriate aliases for the variable names. Avoid using names: ABC, abc, etc.
4. Always try to write optimized codes. Use appropriate tables and joins as per the questions asked.
5 There are some checkpoints given in the question SQL script provided. Keep your eye out for them as they're useful pieces of information you can use to check if the result you have obtained after performing a particular task is correct or not.
